## Data

While the complete set of data associated with this paper can be found on Princeton University's DataSpace (https://doi.org/10.34770/drxn-ek96), we provide a small amount of data in this repository for initial testing. This includes 10 minutes worth of tracks, humidity and temperature data for the complete set of experiments, along with model specifications(but not complete models).

## Analysis

Brief examples of anlysis are available here illustrating how to load and analyze tracks.
